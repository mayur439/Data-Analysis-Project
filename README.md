#City Bike Analysis

The project involves tasks such as cleaning and formatting data, creating charts and graphs to visualize data trends, and identifying patterns and insights within the data. The analysis involved identifying factors such as popular routes or stations, peak usage times, and demographics of bike share users from September 19 to September 20. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide actionable insights that could be used to improve the bike share program and better serve the needs of its users.
